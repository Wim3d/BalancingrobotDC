# BalancingrobotDC
Code of balancing robot with DC motors

  Balancing robot with 6V DC motors
  L293D IC as motor driver (powered by 5V pin of arduino)
  MPU6050 module (powered by 5V pin of arduino)
  Arduino nano V3 (5V), powered via a 9V battery to Vin
  2x Lipo batteries in series
  step down buck converter (Lipo to DC motors). Note measure the voltage at the motors since the L293D had a large voltage drop
